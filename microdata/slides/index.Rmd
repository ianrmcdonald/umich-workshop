## Part 1: Using ACS microdata with tidycensus

---

## What is "microdata?"  

* __Microdata__: individual-level survey responses made available to researchers 

* [The ACS Public Use Microdata Series (PUMS)](https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/microdata.html) allows for detailed cross-tabulations not available in aggregated data

* The 1-year PUMS covers about 1 percent of the US population; the 5-year PUMS covers about 5 percent (so, not the full ACS)

* Data downloads available [in bulk from the Census FTP server](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data/pums/2019/5-Year/) or [from data.census.gov's MDAT tool](https://data.census.gov/mdat/#/search?ds=ACSPUMS5Y2019)

## Microdata and the Census API

class: middle, center, inverse

## Using microdata in tidycensus

---

## Setting up tidycensus

* To use tidycensus, you will need a Census API key.  Visit https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html to request a key, then activate the key from the link in your email.  

* Once activated, use the `census_api_key()` function to set your key as an environment variable

```{r api-key, eval = FALSE}
library(tidycensus)

census_api_key("YOUR KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```


---

## Basic usage of `get_pums()`

.pull-left[

* `get_pums()` requires specifying one or more variables and the state for which you'd like to request data.  `state = 'all'` _can_ get data for the entire USA, but it takes a while!

* The function defaults to the 5-year ACS with `survey = "acs5"`; 1-year ACS data is available with `survey = "acs1"`. 

* The default year is 2019; data are available back to 2006 (1-year ACS) and 2005-2009 (5-year ACS)

]


.pull-right[

```{r first-call, results = 'hide'}
library(tidycensus)

wy_pums <- get_pums(
  variables = c("SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2019
)
```

]

---

```{r}
wy_pums
```

---

## Understanding default data from `get_pums()`

`get_pums()` returns some technical variables by default without the user needing to request them specifically.  These include: 

* `SERIALNO`: a serial number that uniquely identifies households in the sample; 

* `SPORDER`: the order of the person in the household; when combined with `SERIALNO`, uniquely identifies a person;

* `WGTP`: the household weight;

* `PWGTP`: the person weight

---

## Weights and ACS microdata

* Given that PUMS data are a _sample_ of the US population, the weights columns must be used for analysis

```{r tabulate}
library(tidyverse)

wy_age_50 <- filter(wy_pums, AGEP == 50)

print(sum(wy_pums$PWGTP))
print(sum(wy_age_50$PWGTP))
```

---
class: middle, center, inverse

## Working with PUMS variables

---

## Variables available in the ACS PUMS

```{r view, eval = FALSE}
View(pums_variables)
```

* The `pums_variables` dataset is your one-stop shop for browsing variables in the ACS PUMS

* It is a long-form dataset that organizes specific _value codes_ by variable so you know what you can get.  You'll use information in the `var_code` column to fetch variables, but pay attention to the `var_label`, `val_code`, `val_label`, and `data_type` columns

---

## Recoding PUMS variables

.pull-left[

* The `recode = TRUE` argument in `get_pums()` appends recoded columns to your returned dataset based on information available in `pums_variables`

]

.pull-right[

```{r recode, results = 'hide'}
wy_pums_recoded <- get_pums(
  variables = c("SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs1",
  year = 2019,
  recode = TRUE
)
```

]

---

```{r show-recode}
wy_pums_recoded
```

---

## Using variables filters

.pull-left[

* PUMS datasets - especially from the 5-year ACS - can get quite large.  The `variables_filter` argument can return a subset of data from the API, reducing long download times

* This feature is currently only available in the development (GitHub) version of tidycensus

]

.pull-right[

```{r filter, results = 'hide'}
wy_pums_filtered <- get_pums(
  variables = c("SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs5",
  variables_filter = list(
    SEX = 2,
    SCHL = 16:20
  ),
  year = 2019,
  recode = TRUE
)
```


]

---

```{r show-filter}
wy_pums_filtered
```

## Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs)

---

## What is a PUMA?

.pull-left[

* Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs) are the smallest available geographies at which records are identifiable in the PUMS datasets

* PUMAs are redrawn with each decennial US Census, and typically are home to 100,000-200,000 people

* In large cities, a PUMA will represent a collection of nearby neighborhoods; in rural areas, it might represent several counties across a large area of a state

]

.pull-right[

```{r plot-pumas}
library(tigris)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

wy_pumas <- pumas(state = "WY", cb = TRUE)

plot(wy_pumas$geometry)
```

]

---

## Working with PUMAs in PUMS data

* To get PUMA information in your output data, use the variable code `PUMA`

```{r get-pumas, results = 'hide'}
wy_age_by_puma <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "AGEP"),
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs5"
)
```

---

```{r show-pumas}
wy_age_by_puma
```


---

## Custom queries by PUMA

* The `puma` argument in `get_pums()` can be used to obtain data for a specific PUMA or multiple PUMAs - again reducing long download times if specific geographies are required

```{r subset-puma, results = 'hide'}
wy_puma_subset <- get_pums(
  variables = "AGEP",
  state = "WY",
  survey = "acs5",
  puma = "00500"
)
```

---

```{r show-subset-puma}
wy_puma_subset
```


---

## Part 1 exercises

* Try requesting PUMS data using `get_pums()` yourselves, but for a state other than Wyoming.  

* Use the `pums_variables` dataset to browse the available variables in the PUMS.  Create a custom query with `get_pums()` to request data for variables other than those we've used in the above examples.  

---

## Analyzing and modeling PUMS data in R

---

## Considerations when working with PUMS data

* The individual-level microdata returned by `get_pums()` can be used to produce detailed cross-tabulations not available in the aggregate ACS, e.g. from `get_acs()`

* tidyverse tools like dplyr are excellent for producing these tabulations and handling survey weights

* Because data acquired with `get_pums()` are drawn from the ACS, any estimates produced in your analysis will be characterized by error - which can be substantial when cross-tabulations are highly specific


---

## PUMS data and the tidyverse

```{r ms-pums, results = 'hide'}
ms_pums <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "MS",
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2019,
  recode = TRUE
)

ms_age_sex <- ms_pums %>%
  count(SEX_label, AGEP, wt = PWGTP) 
```

---

```{r ms-count}
ms_age_sex
```



---

## Group-wise data tabulation

```{r ms-summary}
ms_pums_summary <- ms_pums %>% 
  mutate(ba_above = SCHL %in% c("21", "22", "23", "24")) %>% 
  group_by(PUMA, SEX_label) %>% 
  summarize(
    total_pop = sum(PWGTP),
    mean_age = weighted.mean(AGEP, PWGTP),
    ba_above = sum(PWGTP[ba_above == TRUE & AGEP >= 25]),
    ba_above_pct = 100 * (ba_above / sum(PWGTP[AGEP >= 25]))
  )
```

---

```{r show-ms-summary}
ms_pums_summary
```


---

## Advanced example: mapping PUMS data

* Use the tigris package to obtain PUMA geometries and join data based on a common identifier for mapping

```{r join-ms-data}
library(tigris)
library(tmap)
options(tigris_use_cache = TRUE)

ms_pumas <- pumas("MS", cb = TRUE)

joined_pumas <- ms_pumas %>%
  left_join(ms_pums_summary, by = c("PUMACE10" = "PUMA")) %>%
  filter(SEX_label == "Female")
```

---

.pull-left[

```{r ms-pums-map}
ms_map <- tm_shape(joined_pumas) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "ba_above_pct", 
              palette = "Greens",
              title = "% of women with\ncollege degree") + 
  tm_layout(legend.outside = TRUE,
            legend.outside.position = "right")
```

]

.pull-right[

```{r show-ms-map}
ms_map
```

]

## Calculating errors around tabulated estimates

---

## Survey design and the ACS PUMS

* As we covered in the first workshop, the American Community Survey is based on a _sample_ of the US population and in turn subject to sampling error

* The complex sample design of the ACS further requires appropriate specification when fitting statistical models using PUMS data

* tidycensus, with help from the survey/srvyr packages, includes tools to assist with these tasks

---

## Getting replicate weights

.pull-left[

* The Census Bureau publishes 80 "replicate weights" that can be used to calculate standard errors around tabulated estimates from microdata

* The `rep_weights` parameter in `get_pums()` makes it easier for users to retrieve all of these variables without having to request all 80 directly.  Choose `rep_weights = "person"` for person-weights or `"household"` for household weights

]

.pull-right[

```{r rep-weights, eval = FALSE}
ms_pums_replicate <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "SEX", "AGEP", "SCHL"),
  state = "MS",
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2019,
  recode = TRUE,
  rep_weights = "person"
)
```

]

---

```{r read-rep-weights, echo = FALSE}
ms_pums_replicate <- read_rds("microdata/data/ms_pums_replicate.rds")
```

```{r show-rep-weights}
ms_pums_replicate
```

---

## Creating a `survey` object

.pull-left[

* The __survey__ package is the standard for handling complex survey samples in R

* The more recent __srvyr__ package wraps __survey__ to allow the use of tidyverse functions on survey objects

* tidycensus includes a function, `to_survey()`, to convert ACS microdata to survey/srvyr objects

]

.pull-right[

```{r svy-object}
library(survey)
library(srvyr)

ms_pums_svy <- ms_pums_replicate %>%
  to_survey(type = "person", 
            design = "rep_weights")

class(ms_pums_svy)
```

]

---

## Calculating estimates and errors with __srvyr__

* srvyr's `survey_*()` family of functions automatically calculates standard errors around tabulated estimates for you 

```{r svy-count}
ms_pums_svy %>% 
  survey_count(PUMA, SEX_label)
```


---

## Complex tabulations with __srvyr__

```{r svy-summary}
ms_svy_summary <- ms_pums_svy %>% 
  mutate(ba_above = SCHL %in% c("21", "22", "23", "24")) %>% 
  filter(AGEP >= 25) %>% 
  group_by(PUMA, SEX_label) %>% 
  summarize(
    age_25_up = survey_total(vartype = "se"),
    ba_above_n = survey_total(ba_above, vartype = "se"),
    ba_above_prop = survey_mean(ba_above, vartype = "se")
    )

glimpse(ms_svy_summary)
```

---

## Converting standard errors to MOEs

* To convert standard errors to the familiar margins of error at a 90 percent confidence level, multiply them by 1.645

```{r svy-plot, eval = FALSE}
ms_svy_summary_moe <- ms_svy_summary %>%
  mutate(ba_above_prop_moe = ba_above_prop_se * 1.645) %>%
  filter(SEX_label == "Female")

ggplot(ms_svy_summary_moe, aes(x = ba_above_prop, y = reorder(PUMA, ba_above_prop))) +
  geom_errorbarh(aes(xmin = ba_above_prop - ba_above_prop_moe, 
                     xmax = ba_above_prop + ba_above_prop_moe)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "navy") +
  labs(title = "Percent of women age 25+ with 4-year college degree",
       subtitle = "PUMAs in Missisippi.  Error bars represent margin of error at 90 percent confidence level.",
       x = "2015-2019 ACS estimate (from PUMS data)",
       y = "") +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  theme_grey(base_size = 14)
```

## Advanced example: modeling with PUMS data

---

## Data setup

* Question (adapted from the tidycensus docs by Matt Herman): what is the relationship between wages/class of worker and commute times in Rhode Island?

```{r ri-data, results = 'hide'}
ri_pums_to_model <- get_pums(
  variables = c("PUMA", "WAGP", "JWMNP", "JWTRNS", "COW", "ESR"),
  state = "RI",
  survey = "acs5",
  year = 2019
  )
```

---

## Data preparation

.pull-left[

* As PUMS data have a _complex sample design_, models fit must account for its data structure where observations are clustered within primary sampling units (households) and strata (PUMAs)

* Use `to_survey(design = "cluster")` to handle this in datasets without replicate weights

* For analysis of subpopulations, `srvyr::filter()` works like `survey::subset()` for appropriate standard error estimation

]

.pull-right[

```{r ri-filter}
ri_model_sd <- ri_pums_to_model %>% 
  mutate(
    emp_type = case_when(
      COW %in% c("1", "2")      ~ "private",
      COW %in% c("3", "4", "5") ~ "public",
      TRUE                      ~ "self"
      )
    ) %>%
  to_survey(design = "cluster") %>%
  filter(
    ESR == 1,   # civilian employed
    JWTRNS != 11, # does not work at home
    WAGP > 0,   # earned wages last year
    JWMNP > 0   # commute more than zero min
  ) 
```

]

---

## Fitting a model

* The family of modeling functions in the __survey__ package should be used for modeling data in survey design objects, e.g. `survey::svyglm()`

```{r ri-model}
model <- survey::svyglm(log(JWMNP) ~ log(WAGP) + emp_type + PUMA, 
                        design = ri_model_sd)
```


---

## Evaluating the model

```{r ri-model-summary}
summary(model)
```

---

## Part 2 exercises

* Using the dataset you acquired from the exercises in Part 1 (or the example Wyoming dataset), tabulate a group-wise summary using the PWGTP column and dplyr functions as you've learned in this section.  

* Advanced follow-up: using `get_acs()`, attempt to acquire the same aggregated data from the ACS.  Compare your tabulated estimate with the ACS estimate.

* Second advanced follow-up: request the same data as before, but this time with replicate weights.  Calculate the margin of error as you've learned in this section - and if you have time, compare with the posted ACS margin of error!

## International Census data resources in R

---

## International Census data

* In the workshops to this point, we've focused on United States Census data.  Demographic data and Censuses are international, however, and so are R resources!

* Options for non-US demographic data are widespread in R, and include: 

--

  - Global data from the US Census Bureau's International Data Base, and 
  
--

  - Country-specific Census data packages from around the world.  We'll review a sampling in a moment!

---

## The US Census International Data Base

* The US Census Bureau International Database includes both historical data on demographic components (population, fertility, mortality, migration) and population projections to 2100

* idbr: my R package to query data from the IDB API.  Not as smooth as tidycensus, but it works!

* Functions: `idb1()` for the 1-year API and `idb5()` for the 5-year API (a bit of a misnomer, as it includes a wide range of yearly demographic variables)

---

## International data with idbr

* Example: how has life expectancy at birth changed in Southeast Asia?

```{r idbr-1, eval = FALSE}
library(idbr)
library(tidyverse)

# Not necessary if you have the development version of idbr
idb_api_key(Sys.getenv("CENSUS_API_KEY"))

se_asia_lex <- idb5(
  country = c("Laos", "Vietnam", "Cambodia", "Thailand"),
  year = 1995:2021,
  variable = "E0",
  country_name = TRUE
)

ggplot(se_asia_lex, aes(x = time, y = E0, color = NAME)) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 18) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) + 
  labs(title = "Change in life expectancy, 1995-2021",
       y = "Life expectancy at birth",
       x = "Year")
```

```{r kenya-1}
# remotes::install_github("Shelmith-Kariuki/rKenyaCensus")
library(rKenyaCensus)
library(tidyverse)

religion <- V4_T2.30 %>%

## Visualizing Kenyan Census data

```{r plot-kenya, eval = FALSE}
ggplot(religion, aes(x = prop_islam, y = reorder(county_title, prop_islam))) + 
  geom_col(fill = "navy", alpha = 0.6) + 
  theme_minimal(base_size = 12.5) + 
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
  labs(title = "Percent Muslim by County in Kenya",
       subtitle = "2019 Kenyan Census", 
       x = "",
       y = "",
       caption = "Data source: rKenyaCensus R package")
```

## Mapping Kenyan Census data

* The rKenyaCensus package includes county boundaries to facilitate mapping of the various indicators in the Census

```{r map-kenya, eval = FALSE}
kenya_islam_map <- KenyaCounties_SHP %>%
  sf::st_as_sf() %>%
  mutate(County = str_remove(County, " CITY")) %>%
  left_join(religion, by = "County") %>%
  mutate(pct_islam = 100 * prop_islam)

tm_shape(kenya_islam_map) + 
  tm_polygons(col = "pct_islam",
              palette = "viridis", 
              style = "jenks",
              n = 7, 
              title = "% Muslim",
              alpha = 0.6)
```

## Other data resources

* Many other international data resources in R exist, e.g. [nomisr](https://github.com/ropensci/nomisr) for UK data and [afrimapr](https://afrimapr.github.io/afrimapr.website/) for Africa-wide datasets

* The [IPUMS International project](https://international.ipums.org/international/) has microdata for over 100 countries; use IPUMS data with the [ipumsr R package](https://github.com/mnpopcenter/ipumsr)
